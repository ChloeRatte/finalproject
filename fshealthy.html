Eating Healthy prolongs your life!</strong></p> <p>In addition to lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits are a major contributor to the large part of the population- a third of adults and 17% of adolescents- who are obese in the United States. Poor diets can also cause illnesses such as heart disease, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.  Many of these can even lead to death. Just eating healthy can help you take the first steps away from these problems.</p></span>
