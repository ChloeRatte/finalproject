<h1>Meet the GWC Team!</h1>

<h2>Meet the Team [pictures of each of us and a little blerb about who we are, what we did in the project and why this stuff was important to us but first another little blerb about our path and GWC]</h2>
<p>
	The YumTime team is a part of an organization called Girls Who Code Adobe. GWC Adobe is trying to teach young girls about code. As a final project we all banded together with righteousness in our hearts to make a website to help those in need.
